	<p>
	Cockatrice is an open-source cross-platform software for playing card games, such as Magic: The Gathering, over a network. It is fully client-server based to prevent any kind of cheating, though it supports single-player games without a network interface as well. Both client and server are written in Qt, supporting both Qt4 and Qt5.
